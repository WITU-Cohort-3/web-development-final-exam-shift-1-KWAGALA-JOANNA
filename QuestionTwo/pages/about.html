            <h2> Cafe dine</h2>
            <p>Cafe Dine Restaurant was found in 2019 by M & J in a city called Seoul. It all began by preparing meals for friends, family and alumni reunions.
                that was the spark off for the Cafe Dine restaurant and now we also have an online food shop.
